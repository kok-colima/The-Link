The death of a loved one has always been one of the most difficult events of the human experience. If the loss is unexpected or shocking in its nature, it could become a traumatic experience, even impossible to overcome for some. Life is meant to be enjoyed, but sometimes grieving can take over your soul and refuse to let go. This application is meant to be a link between life and death, a second chance to reconnect with your loved ones and repair old wounds or simply, to enjoy being in touch with them again.</p>
<p>

Like all technology, this application is not good or bad in its nature, it’s just an instrument to communicate both worlds. It is the user’s responsibility to follow all these instructions properly. The consequences of not doing so could result in unexpected and uncontrolled results.
