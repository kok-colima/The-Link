	The death of a loved one has always been one of the most difficult events of the human experience. If the loss is unexpected or shocking in its nature, it could become a traumatic experience, even impossible to overcome for some. Life is meant to be enjoyed, but sometimes grieving can take over your soul and refuse to let go. This application is meant to be a link between life and death, a second chance to reconnect with your loved ones and repair old wounds or simply, to enjoy being in touch with them again.
		</p>

		<p align="justify">
	Like all technology, this application is not good or bad in its nature, it’s just an instrument to communicate both worlds. It is the user’s responsibility to follow all these instructions properly. The consequences of not doing so could result in unexpected and uncontrolled results.

	1) Don’t start the ceremony until you have finished reading all the instructions.
 		</p>
  
		<p align="justify">
	2) Don’t take any of this lightly or as a joke. Spirits tend to be aggressive when disrespected.
		</p>
  
		<p align="justify">
	3) Type the name of the person you wish to reach and place the mobile on a desk or table. Press start. The participants should then hold hands and form a circle around the table. If you are playing by yourself, use a rope to create the circle. It is of extreme importance that you never break this circle until the ceremony is over.
		</p>
  
		<p align="justify">
	4) Invoke the spirit of your loved one by repeating the following: “We are gathered here to contact the spirit of XX. If you can hear us, please respond to our calling.” Repeat this calling until the iPad vibrates. This means that contact has been established. You can start a conversation by talking out loud. The spirit will communicate by typing his answers on the screen.
		</p>
  
		<p align="justify">
	5) Make sure that the spirit you are talking to, is the spirit of the person you were looking to reach. Remember, this is an open bridge, and others could try to use it too. Ask personal questions that only that person could answer.
		</p>
  
		<p align="justify">
	6) Never ask a spirit to manifest itself through other objects. All communication should only be made through this application.
		</p>
  
		<p align="justify">
	7) If at some point you wish to end the conversation, say goodbye three times and wait until the application closes the communication with the after world. Do not log out until the application indicates that you're allowed to disconnect.
