1) Don’t start the ceremony until you have finished reading all the instructions.
  </p>
  
  <palign="justify">
2) Don’t take any of this lightly or as a joke. Spirits tend to be aggressive when disrespected.
  </p>
  
  <p align="justify">
3) Type the name of the person you wish to reach and place the mobile on a desk or table. Press start. The participants should then hold hands and form a circle around the table. If you are playing by yourself, use a rope to create the circle. It is of extreme importance that you never break this circle until the ceremony is over.
  </p>
  
   <p align="justify">
 4) Invoke the spirit of your loved one by repeating the following: “We are gathered here to contact the spirit of XX. If you can hear us, please respond to our calling.” Repeat this calling until the iPad vibrates. This means that contact has been established. You can start a conversation by talking out loud. The spirit will communicate by typing his answers on the screen.
  </p>
  
   <p align="justify">
5) Make sure that the spirit you are talking to, is the spirit of the person you were looking to reach. Remember, this is an open bridge, and others could try to use it too. Ask personal questions that only that person could answer.
  </p>
  
   <p align="justify">
6) Never ask a spirit to manifest itself through other objects. All communication should only be made through this application. 
  </p>
  
   <p align="justify">
7) If at some point you wish to end the conversation, say goodbye three times and wait until the application closes the communication with the after world. Do not log out until the application indicates that you're allowed to disconnect.
